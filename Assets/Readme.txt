Game Title: Yūrei’s Bullet
Setting
The year is 1868. In an alternate history, the United States invades a rapidly modernizing Japan. During their conquest, American forces uncover an ancient portal sealed within forgotten ruins. When they open it, they awaken hell itself — unleashing demons that slaughter the invaders and spread across Japan.

Premise
You play as Yūrei, a lone samurai whose temple near the ruins. Among the dead, you find the body of a fallen cowboy — and take his hat and revolver. Blending tradition with foreign technology, Yūrei descends into the demon-infested ruins to seal the portal and end hell’s invasion.
